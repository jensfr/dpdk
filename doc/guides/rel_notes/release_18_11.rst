DPDK Release 18.11
==================

.. **Read this first.**

   The text in the sections below explains how to update the release notes.

   Use proper spelling, capitalization and punctuation in all sections.

   Variable and config names should be quoted as fixed width text:
   ``LIKE_THIS``.

   Build the docs and view the output file to ensure the changes are correct::

      make doc-guides-html

      xdg-open build/doc/html/guides/rel_notes/release_18_11.html


New Features
------------

.. This section should contain new features added in this release.
   Sample format:

   * **Add a title in the past tense with a full stop.**

     Add a short 1-2 sentence description in the past tense.
     The description should be enough to allow someone scanning
     the release notes to understand the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list
     like this:

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     Refer to the previous release notes for examples.

     Suggested order in release notes items:
     * Core libs (EAL, mempool, ring, mbuf, buses)
     * Device abstraction libs and PMDs
       - ethdev (lib, PMDs)
       - cryptodev (lib, PMDs)
       - eventdev (lib, PMDs)
       - etc
     * Other libs
     * Apps, Examples, Tools (if significative)

API Changes

   Also, make sure to start the actual text at the margin.
   =========================================================

* A new device flag, RTE_ETH_DEV_NOLIVE_MAC_ADDR, changes the order of
  actions inside rte_eth_dev_start regarding MAC set. Some NICs do not
  support MAC changes once the port has started and with this new device
  flag the MAC can be properly configured in any case. This is particularly
  important for bonding.

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change
     that was announced in the previous releases and made in this release.
